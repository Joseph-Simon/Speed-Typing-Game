# Speed Typing Game

link to game: http://joe-simon.com/Speed-Typing-Game/

This was built using a quick course by Traversy Media on YouTube, built using bootstrap and JavaScript.

After the course I went back and added in levels that automaticly scale as you play, the levels decresse the time.

I have also added in LocalStorage to save your highe score.

ToDO: Add API to generate random words.

How to play- Simply type the word you see as fast as you can. The game will end if time runs out. To start a new game type the next word.
